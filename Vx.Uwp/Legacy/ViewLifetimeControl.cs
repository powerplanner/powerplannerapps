// The objects defined here demonstrate how to make sure each of the views created remains alive as long as 
// the app needs them, but only when they're being used by the app or the user. Many of the scenarios contained in this
// sample use these functions to keep track of the views available and ensure that the view is not closed while
// the scenario is attempting to show it.
//
// As you can see in scenario 1, the ApplicationViewSwitcher.TryShowAsStandaloneAsync and 
// ProjectionManager.StartProjectingAsync methods let you show one view next to another. The Consolidated event
// is fired when a view stops being visible separately from other views. Common cases where this will occur
// is when the view falls out of the list of recently used apps, or when the user performs the close gesture on the view.
// This is a good time to close the view, provided the app isn't trying to show the view at the same time. This event
// is fired on the thread of the view that becomes consolidated.
//
// Each view lives on its own thread, so concurrency control is necessary. Also, as you'll see in the sample,
// certain objects may be bound to UI on given threads. Properties of those objects should only be updated
// on that UI thread.
